- Infrastructure Report Submission: Form for field workers to submit new reports including location, category, description, severity and optional photo upload.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a muted yet hopeful green (#90EE90) to represent growth and sustainability.
- Background color: A light, desaturated shade of the primary green (#F0FFF0) for a clean, unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: An analogous blue (#6495ED), providing contrast without disrupting the calming, natural vibe.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif for both headlines and body text to maintain readability and a modern feel.
- Ensure a clean, map-centric design, optimizing space to focus on geospatial data.
- Employ intuitive icons for need types and severity levels to enable quick comprehension.
