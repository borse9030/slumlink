**Bridging the gap between on-the-ground needs and government action through real-time data and AI-powered insights.**

## 1. The Vision: What is SlumLink?

**SlumLink** is a sophisticated web platform designed to empower Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and government agencies to collaboratively identify, track, and resolve critical infrastructure issues within urban slums. By leveraging geo-mapping, real-time reporting, and generative AI, SlumLink transforms anecdotal field reports into actionable, data-driven development projects.

Our objective is to create a transparent and efficient ecosystem where grassroots-level information directly informs municipal planning and resource allocation, leading to tangible improvements in the quality of life for underserved communities.

## 2. The Problem We're Solving

Urban slums are home to over a billion people worldwide, many of whom lack access to the most basic services: clean water, stable electricity, functional sanitation, and safe educational facilities. A major obstacle to addressing these challenges is the significant information gap between the on-the-ground realities and the government bodies responsible for action.

Traditional methods of reporting are often:
- **Slow & Inefficient**: Paper-based reports or disjointed communication channels lead to long delays.
- **Lacking Data**: Reports often lack precise location data, photographic evidence, or standardized severity assessments, making it difficult to prioritize issues.
- **Opaque**: NGOs and community members have little visibility into the status of their reports, leading to frustration and duplicated efforts.
- **Disconnected**: Patterns across different zones are missed, preventing the implementation of large-scale, impactful solutions.

SlumLink tackles these issues head-on by providing a centralized, transparent, and intelligent platform for infrastructure management.

## 3. The Solution: How SlumLink Works

SlumLink provides two distinct, role-based dashboards to create a seamless workflow from issue reporting to resolution.

### The Workflow

1.  **Report Submission (NGO Users)**
    *   NGO field workers use the **NGO Dashboard** to submit detailed reports about infrastructure problems.
    *   They can pin the exact location of an issue on an interactive map, ensuring geographic accuracy.
    *   Each report includes a title, description, category (e.g., Water, Sanitation), severity level (Low, Medium, High), and an optional photo.

2.  **Data Aggregation & Analysis (Government Users)**
    *   All reports are aggregated in the **Government Dashboard**.
    *   Officials can view all reported issues on a comprehensive map, color-coded by severity.
    *   Powerful filtering tools allow them to sort reports by zone, NGO, status, and type, enabling them to focus on the most critical areas.

3.  **AI-Powered Insights (Government Users)**
    *   SlumLink uses **Google's Gemini models** to analyze the aggregated data.
    *   With a single click, officials can generate AI-powered insights that:
        *   **Summarize** the overall situation across all zones.
        *   Identify the **most urgent, cross-zonal needs**.
        *   Provide **actionable development suggestions** (e.g., "High concentration of water-related reports in adjacent zones suggests the need for a new water pipeline.").

4.  **Action & Resolution**
    *   Armed with precise data and intelligent recommendations, government agencies can allocate resources effectively, update the status of reports, and resolve issues.

## 5. Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or higher)
-   npm or yarn

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd slumlink-project
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

1.  Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project.
2.  Obtain your Firebase project configuration and Google Maps API key.
    -   **Firebase**: Go to your Firebase Console > Project Settings > General. Under "Your apps," select your web app and copy the `firebaseConfig` object values.
    -   **Google Maps**: Go to the Google Cloud Console, enable the "Maps JavaScript API" and "Places API", and get your API key.
3.  Add the following keys to your `.env` file:

```env
# Firebase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=

# Google Maps API Key
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=

# Genkit (Google AI) API Key
GEMINI_API_KEY=
```

### Step 4: Run the Development Server

This command starts both the Next.js frontend and the Genkit AI flows.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application should now be running at [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002).
